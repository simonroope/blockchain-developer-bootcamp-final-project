## Project Idea
To create decentralised fixed income bonds, each constituted as an NFT. 


### What Is a Bond?
A bond is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or government). A bond can be thought of as an I.O.U between the lender and borrower that includes the details of the loan and its payments. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debt holders, or creditors, of the issuer.
The market price of a bond depends on a number of factors: the credit quality of the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment at the time. 


### Why decentralise?
* The most common process for issuing bonds is through underwriting. When a bond issue is underwritten, one or more securities firms or banks, form a syndicate, buy the entire issue of bonds from the issuer and resell them to investors. Decentralisation will allow all market participants to buy and sell assets and at more competitive rates.
* Bonds can be bought and sold in the “secondary market” after they are issued. Most are traded over-the-counter (OTC) between large broker-dealers acting on their clients' or their own behalf. A decentralised market place will broaden bond ownership and enhance bond liquidity.


### Attributes of a Bond
* Issuer:
* Face value: is the money amount the bond will be worth at maturity.
* The coupon rate: is the rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage.
* Coupon dates: are the dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments. Payments can be made in any interval, but the standard is semiannual payments.
* The maturity date: is the date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond.
* The issue price: is the price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds.


### Workflow
* Create bonds: mint NFT.
* Issue bond: transfer NFT from issuer to investor in exchange for issue price amount. 
* Make coupon payments: pay borrower interest on specified dates.
* Bond matures: principal amount is paid back in full by issuer to bond holder.
* Bond defaults: the bond issuer fails to make coupon payments within the specified period.


### Factors for consideration
* Bond rating: Ratings agencies assign bond ratings to bonds and bond issuers, based on their creditworthiness. Over its duration, the credit rating of a bond may change and this change needs to be recorded on-chain. This information is key for the inclusion of a bond in collateralised debt.   
* Bond currency: can trades and interest payments be made in multiple cryptocurrencies, inc stablecoins?
